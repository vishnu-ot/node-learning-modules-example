* In this application i have created 3 functions such as add , div and sub . i have exported these functions using 
module.exports = {add, div, sub} and it is exported in another file index.js using  - const { add, div, sub } = require("./utils")

* Also installed nodemon package to monitors  project directory and automatically restarts  node application when it detects any changes.
